Hard work is the idea that you work more hours than the average person in your field. And that within these working hours, you go work hard on your craft. A great example of someone who works hard is Elon Musk. Musk puts in at least 80 hours of work every single week and is known to make over 120 hours. Why? Musk puts it this way: “ Nobody changes the world working 40-hours a week. ” In other words, the more hours you put in, the faster you get where you want to go. This sounds pretty obvious and it is. But to profit from the value of hard work, there’s another important element to look at. Smart work. You see, working hard without working smart is like hitting a nail with your fist instead of using a hammer. You might go hard at it, but the process takes you much longer. In other words, working hard isn’t a great strategy on its own. Being thoughtful about your work is as important as working hard.
